# CI_W.09 Control Engineering

## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental principles of feedback control, system modeling, and stability. It covers the mathematical representation of dynamic systems using differential equations, transfer functions, and state-space models. The course provides the basics of modern control including time and frequency domain analysis, root locus, Bode plots, and Nyquist criteria for system stability, and follow up of topics related to digital control such as Z-transform analysis, discrete-time system representation, sampling, and aliasing. 

Students will learn to design proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, and control strategies for real-world applications in robotics, automotive systems, and industrial automation.
