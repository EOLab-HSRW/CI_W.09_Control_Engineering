# CI_W.09 Control Engineering

## Entry requirements

Students have to pass:
- CI_3.02 “Signals and systems”
    - Lecture 7: Fourier Transforms
    - Lecture 8: System Stability
    - Lecture 9: z-Transform
    - Lecture 10: Laplace Transform
    - Lecture 13: Relations between CT and DT

## Outline


Lecture 1. Introduction
- Motivate discussion of why control is necessary
- Basic concepts and terminology [Ogata 1.1, Dorf-Bishop 1.1]
    - System
    - Plant
    - Process
    - Disturbances
    - Sensor
    - Actuator
- System cofigurations [Nise 1.3]
    - Open-loop
    - Closed-loop
- Examples of control systems [Dorf-Bishop 1.3, Astrom-Murray 1.3]
- Design process [Nise 1.5] (Nise basically in that section covers the Astrom-Murray chapter 2 in a more introductory way.)
    - [Dorf-Bishop Figure 1.17 offers an analog perpective to Nise]
    - [Astrom-Murray 2.3 can help to extend Step 3 of Nise "Develop a mathematical model"]
    - [Philippsen 1.10 Falls short]
- Computer-Aided Design Tools
    - Show the computational tools available for Control design/simulation
    - MATLAB and simulink (for model-based design)
    - LabView
    - Python
- Summary

Lab/Practical 1.
